# Reporting Security Issues

The RootstockCollective team and community take security vulnerabilities very seriously. Although this project is
currently in its bootstrapping phase (MVP) and falls outside the scope of a Bug Bounty Program, we sincerely appreciate
your responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## Responsible Disclosure

For all security related issues, use the GitHub Security Advisory
["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/rootstockcollective/collective-rewards-sc/security/advisories/new) tab.

The RootstockCollective team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial
reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and
may ask for additional information or guidance.

**Ensure the bug has not already been reported** by searching on GitHub under
[Issues](https://github.com/rootstockcollective/collective-rewards-sc/issues).

## Vulnerability Handling

### Response Time

RootstockCollective will make its best effort to meet the following response times for reported vulnerabilities:

- Time to first response (from report submission) - 5 business days
- Time to triage (from report submit) - 7 business days

We'll try to keep you informed about our progress throughout the process.

### Disclosure Policy

- Public disclosure of a vulnerability makes it ineligible for a bounty.
