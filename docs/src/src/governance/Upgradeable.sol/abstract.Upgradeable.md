**Inherits:** UUPSUpgradeable, [Governed](/src/governance/Governed.sol/abstract.Governed.md)

Base contract to be inherited by governed contracts

_This contract is not usable on its own since it does not have any *productive useful* behavior The only purpose of this
contract is to define some useful modifiers and functions to be used on the governance aspect of the child contract_

## State Variables

### \_governor

governor contract address

```solidity
address internal _governor;
```

### \_\_gap

_This empty reserved space is put in place to allow future versions to add new variables without shifting down storage
in the inheritance chain. See https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable#storage_gaps_

```solidity
uint256[50] private __gap;
```
