**Inherits:** UUPSUpgradeable

Base contract to be inherited by governed contracts

_This contract is not usable on its own since it does not have any *productive useful* behavior The only purpose of this
contract is to define some useful modifiers and functions to be used on the governance aspect of the child contract_

## State Variables

### governor

governor contract address

```solidity
address public governor;
```

### changeExecutor

contract that can articulate more complex changes executed from the governor

```solidity
ChangeExecutor public changeExecutor;
```

### \_\_gap

_This empty reserved space is put in place to allow future versions to add new variables without shifting down storage
in the inheritance chain. See https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable#storage_gaps_

```solidity
uint256[50] private __gap;
```

## Functions

### onlyGovernorOrAuthorizedChanger

Modifier that protects the function

_You should use this modifier in any function that should be called through the governance system_

```solidity
modifier onlyGovernorOrAuthorizedChanger();
```

### \_\_Governed_init

contract initializer

```solidity
function __Governed_init(address changeExecutor_) internal onlyInitializing;
```

### \_checkIfGovernorOrAuthorizedChanger
