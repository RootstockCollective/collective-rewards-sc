## State Variables

### \_governor

governor address

```solidity
address internal _governor;
```

### \_currentChangeContract

changer contract address to be executed

```solidity
address private _currentChangeContract;
```

### \_\_gap

_This empty reserved space is put in place to allow future versions to add new variables without shifting down storage
in the inheritance chain. See https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable#storage_gaps_

```solidity
uint256[50] private __gap;
