[Git Source](https://github.com/rsksmart/builder-incentives-sc/blob/d42f528b61d0ad9f67bea0aad57398332e9fb745/src/gauge/Gauge.sol)

For each project proposal a Gauge contract will be deployed. It receives all the rewards obtained for that project and
allows the builder and voters to claim them.

```solidity
SponsorsManager public immutable sponsorsManager;
```

### totalAllocation

total amount of stakingToken allocated for rewards

```solidity
uint256 public totalAllocation;

### lastUpdateTime

```solidity
mapping(address sponsor => uint256 rewardPerTokenPaid) public sponsorRewardPerTokenPaid;
```
