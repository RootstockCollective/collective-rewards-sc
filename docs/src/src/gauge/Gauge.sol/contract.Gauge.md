# Gauge

[Git Source](https://github.com/rsksmart/builder-incentives-sc/blob/b66d083f8b28b436755b9a1020cbe3fd028cd794/src/gauge/Gauge.sol)

For each project proposal a Gauge contract will be deployed. It receives all the rewards obtained for that project and
allows the builder and voters to claim them.

## State Variables

### rewardToken

address of the token rewarded to builder and voters

```solidity
IERC20 public immutable rewardToken;
```

### sponsorsManager

SponsorsManager contract address

```solidity
address public immutable sponsorsManager;
```

### totalAllocation

total amount of stakingToken allocated for rewards

```solidity
uint256 public totalAllocation;
```

### rewardRate

current reward rate of rewardToken to distribute per second [PREC]

```solidity
uint256 public rewardRate;
```

### rewardPerTokenStored

most recent stored value of rewardPerToken [PREC]

```solidity
uint256 public rewardPerTokenStored;
```

### rewardMissing

missing rewards where there is not allocation [PREC]

```solidity
uint256 public rewardMissing;
```

### lastUpdateTime

most recent timestamp contract has updated state

```solidity
uint256 public lastUpdateTime;
```

### periodFinish

timestamp end of current rewards period

```solidity
uint256 public periodFinish;
```

### builderRewards

amount of unclaimed token reward earned for the builder

```solidity
uint256 public builderRewards;
```

### rewardShares

epoch rewards shares, optimistically tracking the time weighted votes allocations for this gauge

```solidity
uint256 public rewardShares;
```

### allocationOf

amount of stakingToken allocated by a sponsor

```solidity
mapping(address sponsor => uint256 allocation) public allocationOf;
```

### sponsorRewardPerTokenPaid

cached rewardPerTokenStored for a sponsor based on their most recent action [PREC]

```solidity
mapping(address sponsor => uint256 rewardPerTokenPaid) public sponsorRewardPerTokenPaid;
```

### rewards

cached amount of rewardToken earned for a sponsor

```solidity
mapping(address sponsor => uint256 rewards) public rewards;
```
