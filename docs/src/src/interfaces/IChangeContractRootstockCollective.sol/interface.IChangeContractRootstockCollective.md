# IChangeContractRootstockCollective

[Git Source](https://github.com/RootstockCollective/collective-rewards-sc/blob/6d0eca4e2c61e833bcb70c54d8668e5644ba180e/src/interfaces/IChangeContractRootstockCollective.sol)

This interface is the one used by the governance system.

_If you plan to do some changes to a system governed by this project you should write a contract that does those
changes, like a recipe. This contract MUST not have ANY kind of public or external function that modifies the state of
this ChangeContract, otherwise you could run into front-running issues when the governance system is fully in place._

## Functions

### execute

Override this function with a recipe of the changes to be done when this ChangeContract is executed

```solidity
function execute() external;
```
